# Data Demo

## goal

- to demonstrate a data flow from a structured RDBMS to MongoDB via NIFI
- to demonstrate visualization and discovery on top of MongoDB
- to demonstrate the use of docker as a container base for the datasets

## components

| component | description |
|-----------|-------------|
| mysql | source emulation |
| nifi | etl emulation |
| mongodb | target emulation |
| redash | visualization emulation |
| docker | container emulation |
| vagrant | host standup |
| virtualbox | vm emulation |

## process

- establish docker host via vagrant
  - use vagrant up
  - specify a "local" box to load from
  - copy configuration scripts to the new box
  - kick off an ansible_local job to install the necessary components
- pull necessary components into the docker host environment
- start up the containers using docker-compose
- establish sample scripts into the docker host environment
- populate source
- expose for use

## end goal

- locally exposed services (NTP, DNS, LDAP)

## delegation of responsibilities

| Component | Responsibility | Rationale |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Vagrant | bringing up a server environment | specific to environment only |
| Ansible | configuring required docker host | can be used either locally of with a one or more remote targets and independently of vagrant|
| Docker Compose | deploying and actioning environment | runs against a docker host, independent of how that host stood up |


## deployment

- install dnsmasq locally on mac to have \*.consul point to the consul server
